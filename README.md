# RProp-tensorflow

* Resilient backpropagation implementation for tensorflow.
* This code is forked from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirkweissenborn/genie-kb/master/rprop.py".
* This project is for tensorflow not keras.
* If you find any error in this code, please feel free to make an issue in this repository. 
* Dependency: `tensorflow==1.4.0`, `Python 3.5`. But, I think this code will work on the upper version of the tensorflow with slight modification.
